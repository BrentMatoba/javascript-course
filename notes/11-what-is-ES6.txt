What is ES6? 
Introduciton
We've been throwing around the term ES6 since our veyr first lessons, but we haven't taken the time throwing
properly explain what it means or to investigate the implications of it in our code.

ES6 is a version of javascrip that was officially released in the summer of 2015. It included many new features
that make writin gjavascript much easier and cleaner. If you have been following our lessons you have already been learning hese new features because, well, ES6 is just JAVASCRIPT.
