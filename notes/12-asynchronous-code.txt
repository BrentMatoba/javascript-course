Callbacks:
In the recent past, the way that these were most commonly handled were with callbacks, and even now they are stil use
quite a lot in certain circumstances.
A callback fucniton is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or aciton.

Callbacks are functions that get passed into other functions.

For example:

    DO SOMETHINGGG
    }
