One of the most powerful things a web developer can do is fetching data from a server and displaying it creatively on their site. In many cases, the server solely exists for that specific site. The server could contain blog posts, user data, high scores for a game or anything else. In other cases, the server is an open service that serves data to anyone that wants to use it (i.e. weather data or stock prices). In either case, the methods of accessing and then using that data are essentially the same.

APIs
Servers that are created for serving data for external use (in websites or apps) are often referred to as APIs or ‘Application Programming Interfaces’.

There are multiple ways of requesting data from an API, but all of them basically do the same thing. For the most part, APIs are accessed through URLs, and the specifics of how to query these URLs change based on the specific service you are using. For example, WeatherAPI has several types of data that you can request. To get the current weather in a specific location, you can pass in the name of a city (optionally, you can also pass a zip code & even an ip-address!) as a URL query string parameter, like so:

https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=london
The specifics for using any API are usually documented on the service’s website. Check here for the WeatherAPI documentation. If you haven’t already, go ahead and paste the weather URL above, with the city of your choice, into your browser… (we’ll wait).

You’ll probably get an error like this:

{{"error":{"code":1002,"message":"API key is invalid or not provided."}}}
This brings us to another point about APIs. In most cases, you will have to create an account and request an “API key” from the API service before attempting to fetch data from their endpoints (specific URLs that you use to access a particular function or data within the API). Once obtained, an API key will usually have to be included with every data request, such as another URL query string parameter:
