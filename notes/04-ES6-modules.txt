First off, Modules are NOT the same thing as the module pattern we previously discussed.
ES6 Modules are basically the import/export functions from other languages. Its exaclty what you would expect.


Before we can REALLY use modules, we're going to have to learn about NPM and webpack, which are both topics that are VERY useful
to you even beyond this lesson. In the end, the modules themselves are simple to implement, so we're going to take this ch ance to learn
about a few other things.
