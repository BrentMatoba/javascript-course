Classes in Javascript.

So techncially Javascript does NOT have classes in the same way as Java or Ruby. However, ES6 did introduce syntax
for object creation using the class keyword. On the surface, its the exact same as traditional Object Oriented Programming languages.
However, its an important distinction that they are differet systems under the hood, and that there are potential problems
that can arise from assuming that ES6 classes operate like traditional OOP classes. Opponents argue that the Javascript
Es6 class system is syntactic sugar that can be potentially dangerous and misleading.

Despite the controversy, classes are beginning to crop up in real code bases.
THe people at the Odin Project approve of classes and think they are fine to use.
However I SHOULD learn how to use prototypes as well, I can't use classes just because they're comfortable.
