Introduction
Asynchronous code can become difficult to follow when it has a lot of things going on. async and await are two keywords that can help make asynchronous read more like synchronous code. This can help code look cleaner while keeping the benefits of asynchronous code.

For example, the two code blocks below do the exact same thing. They both get information from a server, process it, and return a promise.

function getPersonsInfo(name) {
  return server.getPeople().then(people => {
    return people.find(person => { return person.name === name });
  });
}
